## Lustrous Void

Lustrous Void is a small client-side mod that tries to replicate the end sky in the Echoing Void DLC. The 'stars' twinkle and are generated from the world seed. The number of stars varies between 10,000 and 15,000 based on world seed. They are invisible when the Ender Dragon is alive.
